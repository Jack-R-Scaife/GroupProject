## Project Ideas

### What we discussed

Discussed creating a data-driven application. This is when the data used by the application drives the output shown.  

Everyone leaning towards creating a web application with an additional mobile application for those in the group who want more of a challenge. Topics included various backend languages, frameworks, and databases. Agreed these were good topics for research.  

Discussed potential application ideas such as a weather data application and a local lost property application with QR code functionality. Also suggested looking at current or past hackathon project briefs for ideas.

### Git and GitHub

Group agreed to use a GitHub repository for the group project. The repository will include directories for weekly logs and team meeting minutes, helping to keep a history of the project. Markdown format will be used for minutes and logs. GitHub Student Developer Pack was also suggested.

### Agile Methodology

Agreed to use agile methodology for development, but keeping it simple for those who are unfamiliar with agile. Importance of clarity in initial project goals discussed.

### Project Management
