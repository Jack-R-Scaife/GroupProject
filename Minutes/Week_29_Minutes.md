## Meeting Discussions

### Previous Sprint

Team communication has been reduced as Calum has increased personal responsibilities and Jack is now back but in a reduced capacity for the short term due again to personal circumstances. Progress has stalled on the design of the schedule page, however, the room and task pages are now almost feature complete with a couple of design tweaks required to allow different interactions based on a user's privilege level and updating of rooms/tasks without deleting and recreating them. The tasks remaining at the end of the sprint were as follows: 

- Password Recovery
- Alternative Logins
- Schedule page frontend
- List view for user dashboard

**Decision:** Remaining tasks will be extended into the next sprint and a reduced set of tasks will be added to the sprint.

### Next Sprint

As there is limited communication at the moment tasks will be chosen by individual team members, added to the sprint and completed as they are able to complete them.

**Decision** Tasks may be added to the sprint mid-sprint as appropriate, the focus will remain on getting all data into the application
**Decision** The following tasks will be added to the next sprint:

- Multi-admin support
- Allow admins to kick users from their household
- User Rule Requests
- General housekeeping week 29.

### Review of Backlog

As there is limited communication at the moment no discussion took place and tasks will be discussed then added to the backlog throughout the week as they are brought forward to the group.
