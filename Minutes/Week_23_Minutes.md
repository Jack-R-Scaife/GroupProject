## Meeting Discussions

### Previous Sprint

All objectives were complete with extra time and only half of the team performing tasks. We discussed whether to reduce sprint cycles and/or increase tasks per sprint.

**Decision:** We will reduce the sprint period to 1 week and increase the workload for the next sprint. Sprint workloads will be determined dynamically depending on how much time the different members believe they can commit to the project.

### Next Sprint

We discussed what would be the first milestone for the project, that we should work towards for the next sprint. 

**Decision:** Get the basic structure of the app implemented, and allow all data to be inputted.

#### High-level list of features added to the sprint:
- Implement form submissions in Ajax
- Initial implementation of the navigation sidebar for the Main Dashboard
- Creation, updating and deletion of: Rooms, Tasks, Schedules, Rules
- Initial implementation of interfaces for: Rooms, Tasks, Schedules, Rules

**Reasoning:** This will allow us to start implementing more complicated features both on the frontend and backend relatively independently of each other.

### Product Backlog

We discussed features that we felt should go on the backlog.

**Decisions:**
- A draft backlog was created and Jack will create the actual backlog on Asana.
- A meeting needs to be setup with the client to get an idea of what criteria are important to him and his opinion on the current state and extrapolated direction of the application.

#### High-level list of features added to backlog:
- Unique auto-generated invite links.
- Password resets.
- Main dashboard views.
- User created, admin approved rules.
- Rota generation.
- Changing schedules midway through a rota cycle.
- Restricting tasks to specific rooms.
- 2-Factor authentication.
- Gamification.
- Photo verification of completed tasks.
- Application logo.
- AWS Lambda based rota generation.

### Cleaning App Name

We discussed what we thought the app should be called as Jack had some good suggestions.

**Decision:** We have called the application **CleanSync**.

## Action Items:

1. **All Members:** Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://www.github.com/cogilv25/blob/main/Documentation/Contribute.md) to complete tasks from the Asana Board.
2. **Jack:** Populate Backlog and To-Do columns on the Asana board.
