# Client Minutes 27/02/2024
## Introduction
We had a meeting with the client in order to get some feedback on the project in it's current state, discuss with the client what criteria are most important to them, and ask about any additional features that they would like to see in the final product.

## Feedback
### Overall Design
- Desktop view was commented on as being very well laid out and easy to navigate.
- Colours were liked although client suggested that options would be good for end users.
- Fonts were neither liked nor disliked.

### Features/Mechanics
Although there wasn't very much to show in terms of implemented features the client seemed happy with what was there.

## Criteria

### Responsiveness
- The client feels it is likely that many users will bve using mobile devices and as such as expressed a strong desire to ensure the application is responsive on screens of all sizes down to a reasonable minimum.

### Ease of Use
- A wide audience will be using the application and as such the client remarked that it is important to make the interface intuitive and easy to use. As the mechanics of the application are quite complicated it will take an especially good design to achieve this.
- Accessibility is a concern as not all students will necessarily be able to participate if they have specific needs and so these should be taken into consideration.

### Legislation
The client has remarked that it is important for the web application to follow all relevant legislation as they could have legal action taken against them if any legal requirements are not met.
- GDPR guidelines will have to be researched and followed.
- Where cookies are used permission will have to be received from the user before storing them.
- If any third party resources are used these must not infringe copyright laws.
- Any industry specific regulations will have to be taken into account.

## Features

### Option for multiple users for one physical email/user
- Looking forward the application may be expanded to target a mass audience and not just students, for example families.
- It is envisaged that some users may just want to create all the users as 'virtual' users and not have to have seperate emails, signup, etc for each member of the family (especially young children).

### Customization
The client has remarked that it is common for people to have differing tastes in terms of colour and visual style and it would be good to have multiple options in these factors.
- A selection of pre-designed theme's to choose from including a dark mode.
- Individual selection of theme components: fonts, colours, etc

### Expansion of concept 
Expansion of concept to include management of general house tasks such as cooking and cleaning, as well as who pays for what etc, this is a very large increase in scope. Client liked the name HouseSync in relation to this suggestion.
