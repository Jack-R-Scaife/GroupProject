## Github Developer Pack
See if it is possible to sign up for [Github Developer Pack](education.github.com/pack) through UHI and do so.
<details>
	Wouldn't accept my Student ID, it complained about not having the name of the university and said logo's were not accepted. It also mentioned about having a google translate window if any of the id was not in english so I thought it may trick the system to show google translate from english -> english and it has accepted it, only time will tell if it goes through.
