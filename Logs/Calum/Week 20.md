	<ul>
		<li>Natively compiled languages like Go and Rust are attractive options for projects where security and performance are paramount, however, they have a steep learning curve and limited libraries.</li>
		<li>MVC prioritizes modularity over minimalism. Django and Ruby on Rails provide a solid framework and large selection of tools but compromise on flexibility and learning curve.</li>
		<li>Slim offers a minimalist approach, providing tools to speed up development while minimizing learning curve.</li>
		<li>In conclusion MVC frameworks are the optimal choice. For those with prior experience, choose Ruby on Rails, Python or another heavyweight framework, however, for those new to the architecture Slim would be more pragmatic</li>
		<li>Additionally, Amazonâ€™s AWS Lambda can be used for computationally heavy components to improve scalability.</li>
