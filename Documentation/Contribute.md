# Contribution Guide

## An important notice to GitHub users who may randomly stumble across this repo
This is a University assignment and thus we cannot accept any contributions outside of the team.

## Asana
- It's **Important** you do these steps before you start working on your feature / issue so that team members are not working on the same things at the same time!
- Goto the [Asana](https://asana.com), login and goto the team project board.
- Choose a task from the To-Do column (Make sure you know what the requirements are for the task).
- Assign yourself to your chosen task.
- Move the task into the In Progress column.
- Complete your task following the Github instructions below.
- Once your task is complete; mark it as complete and move it to the Completed column.
- A final note, there is a help required column in Asana which you can use if stuck but it would be advisable to also send a message into the discord and someone will try help!

## Github
- Fork the repository, this will create your own version of the project which you will be able merge with the main repository by submitting a pull-request.
- Pull from your fork to your working environment.
- Make the changes you want to make to your local repo, then commit and push to your remote fork on github.
- Go to GitHub.com and submit a pull request with a Title and description containing any comments to help the admin understand what your changes do.
- If you have to make any changes to your pull request before it is accepted then all you have to do is commit and push to your fork again then notify the repo owner that you have done so.
- Once your request has been accepted you are all done!
