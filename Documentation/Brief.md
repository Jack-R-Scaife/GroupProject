# Project Brief
## Project Purpose
The project aims to develop an application for a non-profit organization that assists students in managing the cleaning and tidying responsibilities of shared accommodation facilities. The application seeks to facilitate cooperation among co-habitants through a structured and user-friendly rota system, ultimately promoting a cleaner and more organized living environment.

## Project Scope & Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly application for managing cleaning responsibilities in shared student accommodations.
- Implement a secure login/registration system.
- Allow creation of household groups and task management within these groups.
- Incorporate scheduling features and task rotation based on user availability and preferences.
- Introduce a reward system to motivate users to complete tasks.
- Explore potential integrations for alternative logins and consider the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Constraints
- Limited budget and resources.
- Time: Project Deadline to design and develop the application.
- Balancing simplicity in design with the complexity of features.
- Scalability issues if the plans are too small or too large to accomplish / under accomplish.

## Outline of Project Product

### The application will include:

- Registration and Login: A secure system with options for alternative logins.
- Household Management: Users can create and manage household groups.
