# Introduction
Non-profit organization for students has identified that many of the students they are associated with are having problems sharing the responsibility of cleaning and tidying shared accommodation facilities with their co-habitants. The organisation requires an application to be created with the aim of helping it's students to work together with their co-habitants to keep the accommodations clean and tidy. It is envisaged that this will be done by creating a rota system that works around the needs of the users.

Other thoughts on potential "clients":
- University hoping to get their own students in halls of residence to clean up more / better
- A cleaning supplies company who wants to sell their products / make a subscription system through the application (could include cost-sharing).
- A startup company / investor looking to build a company centred around the app (financial incentive would probably be to create a SAAS based product)
# Proposed System
Write up describing features in plain english.

# Features
- Secure Login / Registration System
- Create a household and invite other users
- Add / remove tasks from households
- Add / remove rules from households
	- Ex. Certain people don't do certain tasks.
	- Ex. Certain tasks are performed during a certain period of the day / a certain day.
	- Ex. How the rota distributes/balances tasks between users (points, time, quantity).
	- Ex. Certain people have more to do than others.
- Set a schedule for yourself when you are able to clean
- Generate a rota based on the provided rules, schedules and tasks
- Users earn points when they complete a task. completing enough tasks earns rewards, for example stars / achievements, maybe a leader board for the household.
- Alternative logins for ease of access such as google, facebook, instagram, microsoft. Perhaps 2FA if it seems reasonably doable?
