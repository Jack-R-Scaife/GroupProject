# Add 5 Rooms and 5 Tasks
## Process
- Think about your own home and attempt to add 5 rooms to the application.
- Thinking about these rooms attempt to add some cleaning tasks that would be performed in some or all of these rooms. You do not need 1 task per room for example one task could be applicable to multiple rooms or a room may not have any applicable tasks but the tasks must all apply to at least 1 room.
- Now attempt to link the tasks to all the rooms that require that task top be performed.

## Test Co-ordinator Notes
- The user tried to access assigned tasks on the rooms page to create a task.
- When the user pressed update they waited a short period for feedback then asked if it had worked.

## User Evaluation
- Did you have any difficulties with the process?
	- No, fairly simple.
- Were there any confusing aspects about the process?
	- Not really, just creating rooms, it would be good if assign tasks said no tasks or something.
- Any other comments?
	- An apply all button for assigning tasks would be nice.
	- Auto selecting the newly created task would be useful.

- Did you have any difficulties with the process?
	- Once the process was understood no.
- Were there any confusing aspects about the process?

- Any other comments?
	- An apply all button would be nice, to apply a schedule to every day at once.
	- or a copy function between days.
	- I assumed the process was that a range was selected then assigned as cleaning or not-cleaning so got a little confused at first.
